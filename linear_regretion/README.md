 # Linear Regression Implementation

This repository contains a simple implementation of linear regression in Python, along with a README file to explain the concept and usage.

## Linear Regression

Linear regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables (input features) and the dependent variable (output).

## Implementation Details

### `mean_squared_error` Function
- Calculates the mean squared error between true and predicted values.

### `generate_data` Function
- Generates synthetic data for training the linear regression model.
